# hello-wood
A test repository

Hello, my name is Alycia Griesi
I figure that there is some inline styling to this editor I am not familiar with
# this is a heading 
** idk what this is
* or this for that matter 
<!-- looks like we got a comment here -->
and it looks like we still have a heading
** so if you want multiple line heading use two asterisks, one line heading is just the pound sign

it looks like you <i> can </i> do html inline? idk we'll see when I publish this.
